Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, all fees hereunder are payable in United States dollars. Additionally, Customer must provide all purchase order numbers (if applicable) to Powered_by by no later than the applicable Start Date as specified in the Order Form. All payments shall be made through automated clearing house (ACH) transfers, or wire transfers, credit or debit card to Powered_by's designated account, unless otherwise agreed by Powered_by. Fees do not include any customizations of the Powered_by Solution (nor support for any such customizations, unless otherwise agreed in writing).
            </p>
            
            <p>
              2.2. Excess Usage. If Customer's use of the Powered_by Solution exceeds the number of License Units set forth in the Order Form, Customer will be billed for and Customer will pay those overages at a prorated amount for the remainder of the applicable License Term under the Order Form, based on the pricing specified in the applicable Order Form. If Powered_by believes in good faith that Customer's use of the Powered_by Solution exceeds the number of License Units set forth on the Order Form, Powered_by may (i) audit Customer's use of the Powered_by Solution (not more frequently than twice per calendar year), upon at least twenty-four (24) hours' notice, and (ii) require that Customer provide Powered_by with all relevant records within five (5) business days of such request in order to determine if Customer's use of the Powered_by Solution exceeds the number of authorized License Units.

            <p>
              2.3. Payment Terms. Customer acknowledges that purchases made under this Agreement are neither contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features of the Powered_by Solution nor dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Powered_by regarding future functionality or features of the Powered_by Solution. All fees shall be fixed during the Initial Term (as defined in Section 5) unless Customer purchases additional License Units. If the number of purchased License Units does not increase upon renewal, then all Powered_by Solution and support fees will increase by the percentage specified in the Order Form at the start of each applicable Renewal Term (as defined in Section 5). If Customer is overdue on any payment, then Powered_by may (i) require that Customer pay a late fee equal to the lesser of 1.5% of the then-outstanding unpaid balance per month or the maximum amount allowable by law, and/or (ii) suspend Customer's use of and access to the Powered_by Solution and/or Services associated with Customer's account until such non-payment is corrected. Customer represents and warrants that the billing and contact information provided to Powered_by is complete and accurate, and Powered_by shall have no responsibility for any invoices that are not received due to inaccurate or missing information provided by Customer. All amounts invoiced under this Agreement and any Order Form shall be paid by Customer in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction, or withholding (excluding any tax withholding deductions as required by law).
            </p>
            
            <p>
              2.4 Credit Cards. If Powered_by authorizes you to pay by credit or debit card in writing, you: (i) will provide Powered_by or its designated third-party payment processor with valid credit or debit card information; and (ii) hereby authorize Powered_by or its designated third-party payment processor to charge such credit or debit card for all items listed in the applicable Order Form or SOW or as otherwise agreed by the parties. Such charges must be paid in advance or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form or SOW (if applicable). You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information and notifying Powered_by in a timely manner of any changes to such information.

            <p>
              2.5 Taxes. The fees paid by Customer are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties ("Taxes") imposed by taxing authorities, if any, and Customer shall be responsible for payment of all such Taxes, excluding taxes based on Powered_by's income. Customer represents and warrants that the billing and contact information provided to Powered_by is complete and accurate, and Powered_by shall have no responsibility for any invoices that are not received due to inaccurate or missing information provided by Customer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              2.6 Payment Through Partner. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Customer has licensed the Powered_by Solution from a Powered_by Partner, then Customer shall make its payments for the Powered_by Solution directly to such Partner, and the payment terms agreed by Customer and such Partner shall supersede and govern to the extent anything in this Section 2 conflicts with such payment terms.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-white">3. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>
              3.1 Confidential Information and Restrictions. "Confidential Information" means all information disclosed by a party ("Disclosing Party") to the other party ("Receiving Party"), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as "confidential" or "proprietary," or that, given the nature of the information or circumstances surrounding its disclosure, should reasonably be understood to be confidential.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Confidential Information" does not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party will: (i) not use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information for any purpose outside of this Agreement; (ii) not disclose such Confidential Information to any person or entity, other than its Affiliates, employees, consultants, subcontractors, subprocessors, agents and professional advisers ("Representatives") who have a "need to know" for the Receiving Party to exercise its rights or perform its obligations hereunder, provided that such employees, consultants, and agents are bound by agreements or, in the case of professional advisers, ethical duties respecting such Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of this Section 3; and (iii) use reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall be liable for any breach of this section by its Representatives. If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or court order to make any disclosure of such Confidential Information, it will first give written notice of such requirement to the Disclosing Party, and, to the extent within its control, permit the Disclosing Party to intervene in any relevant proceedings to protect its interests in its Confidential Information, and provide full cooperation to the Disclosing Party in seeking to obtain such protection. Further, this Section 3 will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt without any restriction on its disclosure; (ii) is or has become public knowledge or publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              3.2. Equitable Relief. The Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information could cause substantial harm to the Disclosing Party for which damages alone might not be a sufficient remedy and, therefore, that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law or equity.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              3.3. Feedback. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (a) any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other information about Powered_by, the Powered_by Solution, the Services, the Documentation or other materials provided by Powered_by (collectively, "Feedback") provided by Customer are non-confidential, (b) Powered_by will have full discretion to determine whether or not to proceed with the development of any requested enhancements, new features or functionality, and (c) Powered_by will have the full, unencumbered right, without any obligation to compensate or reimburse Customer, to use, incorporate and otherwise fully exercise and exploit any such Feedback in connection with its products and services.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-white">4. Proprietary Rights</h2>
            <p>
              4.1 Ownership.

            </p>
            
            <p>
              4.2 Third Party Components. Customer acknowledges that the rights granted under this Agreement do not provide Customer with title to or ownership of the Powered_by Solution, in whole or in part. Certain "free" or "open source" based software (the "FOSS Software") and third party software included with the Powered_by Solution (the "Third Party Software") is shipped with the Powered_by Solution but is not considered part of the Powered_by Solution hereunder. Use, reproduction, and distribution of FOSS Software is governed by the terms of the applicable open source software license and not this Agreement. Powered_by will provide Customer with a list of the FOSS Software and Third Party Software embedded in the Powered_by Solution upon request. With respect to Third Party Software included with the Powered_by Solution, such Third Party Software suppliers are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement. The Powered_by Solution and Third Party Software may only be used and accessed by Customer as prescribed by the instructions, code samples, on-line help files and technical documentation made publicly available by Powered_by for the Powered_by Solution, as may be updated from time to time by Powered_by (the "Documentation"). Powered_by will not be responsible for any act or omission of any third party, including the third party's access to or use of any Customer data or the performance of the Powered_by Solution in combination with such Third Party Software.

              This Agreement will be in full force and effect beginning on the earlier of the start date of the first Order Form entered into hereunder and the date you first access or otherwise use the Powered_by Solution, and will remain in effect until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section. Termination of a specific Order Form will not affect the effectiveness of this Agreement or any other Order Form. Unless indicated otherwise in an Order Form, each Order Form shall be valid from the earliest start date therein through the initial end date therein (the "Initial Term"). If either party commits a material breach of this Agreement, and such breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement, except that Powered_by may immediately terminate this Agreement and/or terminate or suspend Customer's use of and access to the Powered_by Solution associated with Customer's account upon Customer's breach of Section 1.2 (Restrictions on Use) or Section 2.1 (Fees). Additionally, Powered_by may temporarily suspend access to the Powered_by Solution if Customer's use poses a security risk or adversely impacts Powered_by's business. Either party may also terminate this Agreement upon written notice if (a) the other party suspends payment of its debts or experiences any other insolvency or bankruptcy-type event or (b) there are no Order Forms or SOWs then in effect. Upon expiration or termination of an Order Form, for any reason, all rights granted to Customer with respect to such Order Form shall terminate and Customer shall destroy any copies of the Powered_by Solution and Documentation provided under such Order Form within Customer's possession and control. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each Receiving Party will return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party's option, the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information in the Receiving Party's possession or control.

              7.1. By Powered_by. Powered_by agrees to defend, at its expense, Customer against (or, at Powered_by's sole option, settle) any third party claim to the extent such claim alleges that the Powered_by Solution infringes or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret of a third party, and Powered_by shall pay all costs and damages finally awarded against Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction as a result of any such claim.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              7.2. Remedies. In the event that the use of the Powered_by Solution is, or in Powered_by's sole opinion is likely to become, subject to such a claim, Powered_by, at its option and expense, may (a) replace the applicable Powered_by Solution with functionally equivalent non-infringing technology, (b) obtain a license for Customer's continued use of the applicable Powered_by Solution, or (c) terminate the applicable Order Form and provide a pro-rata refund of the subscription fees under such Order Form that have been paid in advance for the remainder of the License Term under such Order Form (beginning on the date of termination).
            </p>
            
            <p>
              7.3. Limitations. The foregoing indemnification obligation of Powered_by will not apply: (1) if the Powered_by Solution is or has been modified by Customer or its agent; (2) if the Powered_by Solution is combined with other non-Powered_by products, applications, or processes, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (3) to any unauthorized use of the Powered_by Solution or breach of this Agreement; or (4) if Customer fails to install or use any functionally equivalent non-infringing aspect of the Powered_by Solution that would have avoided the alleged infringement. The foregoing shall be Customer's sole remedy with respect to any claim of infringement of third party intellectual property rights.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              7.4 By Customer. Customer agrees to defend, at its expense, Powered_by and its Affiliates, its suppliers and its resellers against any third party claim to the extent such claim alleges, arises from, or is made in connection with Customer's breach of Section 1 (Powered_by Solution) or Section 9 (Data Use), any High Risk Use, or Customer's negligence or willful misconduct. Customer shall pay all costs and damages finally awarded against Powered_by by a court of competent jurisdiction as a result of any such claim.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              7.5 Indemnification Requirements. In connection with any claim for indemnification under this Section 7, the indemnified party must promptly provide the indemnifying party with notice of any claim that the indemnified party believes is within the scope of the obligation to indemnify, provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Section 7, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party's defense of such claim. The indemnified party may, at its own expense, assist in the defense if it so chooses, but the indemnifying party shall control the defense and all negotiations related to the settlement of any such claim. Any such settlement intended to bind either party shall not be final without the other party's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that Customer's consent shall not be required when Powered_by is the indemnifying party if the settlement involves only the payment of money by Powered_by.
