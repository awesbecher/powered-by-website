            <h2>When We Share Personal Information</h2>
            <p>We take care to only share, transmit, or grant access to Personal Data when there is a business need.

The parties and scenarios in which we may share personal data with include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Partners and subsidiaries - these are companies we have created, acquired, partnered or merged with;</li>
                <li>Service Providers, vendors, and sub-processors - these are companies we have contracted with to provide services on our behalf including but not limited to hosting our Services, financial services, insurance providers, advertising firms, event sponsors, and background check services;</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Please note Powered_by does not sell Personal Information for monetary value. However, we may disclose Personal Information to third parties, such as our subprocessors, to deliver our products and services, which is considered a sale of Personal Information as defined by CCPA.</p>
            
            <h3>Intentional Disclosures to Third Parties</h3>
            <h4>Websites</h4>
            <p>As part of the functionality we make available on our Websites and to better reach our customers and prospective customers, there may be categories of third parties that are authorized by us to operate on our Websites and access your Personal Data, such as your contact data, IP address or cookies. Depending on your location (for example, California and the European Union), Powered_by only shares Personal Data with such third parties if you agree to such sharing via your privacy setting selections. In other parts of the world, this information may be automatically collected when you visit our websites. At any time, you may choose to withdraw your decision to share personal data with these third parties through our websites by visiting the Privacy Rights and Choices section below.</p>
            <h4>Products and Services</h4>
            <p>As a part of our Service delivery and fulfillment obligations we may share Personal Data, such as account and financial information, with the applicable third parties. Powered_by only shares the Personal Data with such third parties as required to deliver services.</p>
            
            <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Your Personal Data may be collected, transferred to, and stored by us in the United States, and by our employees, subsidiaries and third parties that are based in other countries. Therefore, Personal Data may be processed outside your jurisdiction, and in countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission or your local legislature and/or regulator, and that may not provide for the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction, such as the European Economic Area. To ensure that the recipient of your Personal Data offers an adequate level of data protection, standard contractual clauses (SCCs), as detailed in GDPR Article 46, are utilized when data is transferred.</p>
            
            <h2>How We Secure Your Data</h2>
            <h3>Data Protection</h3>
            <p>Powered_by has an inherent responsibility to protect the data our customers share with us. Our Services are built with privacy in mind and are designed to be used in a manner consistent with U.S. and international data privacy regulations. We continue to look for innovative ways to improve our overall security posture, identify and mitigate any potential risks. Information Security at Powered_by is, therefore, a critical business function which we have incorporated into all aspects of our business practices and operations. We maintain a comprehensive, written information security program that contains industry-standard administrative and technical safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personal Data.</p>
            <h3>Data Retention</h3>
            <p>We will retain your Personal Data for a period of time that is consistent with the original purpose of the data collection, or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data by considering the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, and on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).</p>
            
            <h2>Privacy Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p>The information below explains your privacy rights, the choices you have regarding how your Personal Data is managed, and how to exercise your rights. Depending on your jurisdiction the privacy rights you are entitled to may differ. However, Powered_by respects your privacy, as such we will make our best efforts to honor your privacy rights and choices regardless of locale. All parties have the rights listed below.</p>
